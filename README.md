This project is a Library Management System designed to help libraries efficiently manage their operations, including cataloging books, tracking borrowing and returns, maintaining member records, and generating reports on library statistics. It focuses on utilizing data structures and algorithms to create a scalable, efficient system for library administration.

## Features

- **Book Cataloging**: Add, remove, and search for books based on title, author, or other criteria.
- **Borrowing and Return Management**: Track when books are borrowed, returned, and calculate fines for overdue books.
- **Member Management**: Maintain a database of library members and track their activity.
- **Reports**: Generate reports on library statistics such as the most borrowed books, overdue books, and fines collected.
- **Reservations and Waitlists**: Implement a reservation system with queues for books that are currently checked out.

## Learning Outcomes

Students will:

- Utilize **data structures** like linked lists, hash tables, trees, and queues to manage and organize library data.
- Understand and implement **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with databases to manage book and member records.
- Use **searching and sorting algorithms** (e.g., merge sort, quicksort, binary search) to find and organize library information efficiently.
- Handle **complex queries** and operations within the system.
- Gain experience in implementing a **user-friendly interface** for library staff and members.

## Core Concepts

### Data Structures
- **Arrays, Linked Lists, or Hash Tables** for storing book and member records.
- **Trees** (like Binary Search Trees or Tries) for hierarchical organization and faster searches.
- **Queues or Priority Queues** to handle reservations and waitlists.

### Algorithms
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implement sorting (merge sort, quicksort) to organize books by title, author, or other attributes.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Use binary search or linear search for fast lookups.
- **Reservation Management**: Implement queues to handle book reservations and waiting lists efficiently.

### Database
- Implement **CRUD operations** for both books and members.
- Handle operations like borrowing, returning books, and calculating fines for overdue books.

### User Interface

- **Librarian Interface**: Add, remove, and manage book inventory, view and track member activities, generate reports.
- **Member Interface**: Search for available books, reserve books, view borrowing history, and handle returns.

## Real-World Applications

This system can be adapted and scaled for:

- **Educational Institutions**: Automate library operations such as cataloging, inventory management, and generating reports.
- **Public Libraries**: Manage large collections of books, check-in/check-out processes, and reservations.
